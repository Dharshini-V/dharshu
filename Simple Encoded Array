Simple Encoded Array:  Maya has stored few confidential numbers in an array(array of int).To ensure that others do not find the numbers easily,she has applied a simple encoding.
Encoding Used: Each array element has been substituted with a value that is the sum of its original value and its succeeding element’s value.
i.e. arr[i]=origial value of arr[i]+original value of arr[i+1];
e.g. value in arr[0]=original value of arr[0]+original value of arr[1]
Also note that the value of last element i.e. arr[last index] remains unchanged.
For example,
If the encoded array is {7,6,8,16,12,3}
The original array should have been {2,5,1,7,9,3}
Provided the encoded array, you are expected to find the-
a. First number (value of index 0) in the original array
b. Sum of all numbers in the original array
Inputs:
First line contains input1  represents the size of the array input1[];
Second line contains input2  represents the encode array

The program is expected to-
·         Find the value of the first number of the original array and print it and
·         Find the sum of all numbers in original array and print it
Note that the output1 and output2 should be returned as –
Assumption: The array elements can be positive and/or negative numbers
Example 1:
If the encoded array is {7,6,8,16,12,3}
The Original array should have been {2,5,1,7,9,3}
So, First number in original array=2
Sum of all numbers in original array=27
Example 2:
If the encoded array is {-2,-7,-12,-15}
The Original array should have been {8,-10,3,-15}
So, First number in original array=8
Sum of all numbers in original array=-14
