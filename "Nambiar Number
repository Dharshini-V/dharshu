The "Nambiar Number" Generator:M.Nambiar has devised a mechanism to process any given mobile number and thus generate a new resultant number.He calls this mechanism as the "Nambiar Number Generator" and the resultant  number is referred to as the "Nambiar Number". The mechanism is as follows in the given mobile number,starting with the first digit,keep on adding all subsequent digits till the state (odd or even)of the digit.Continue this from the subsequent digit till the last digit of the mobile number is reached.Concatenating the sums thus generated results in the Nambiar Number.The below examples will help to illustrate this.                                                                     
Example 1
If the given mobile number is 9880127431                                                                
The first pass should start with the first digit                                                                     
First digit is 9 which is odd. So we will keep adding subsequent digits till the sum becomes even.               
9+8=17 (17 is odd,so continue adding the digits)
9+8+8=25 (25 is odd,so continue adding the digits)
9+8+8+0=25 (25 is odd,so continue adding the digits)
9+8+8+0+1=26 (26 is even,which is opposite to the state of the first digit 9)
so,Stop first pass here and remember that the result at the end of first pass=26                   
Now we enter the second pass              
The second pass should start after the digit where we stopped the first pass.
In the first pass we have added the digits 9,8,8,0 and 1.
So,the first digit for second pass will be 2,which is even.
Now,we will keep adding subsequent digits till the sum becomes  odd.
2+7=9 (9 is odd,which is opposite to the state of the first digit 2)
So,Stop second pass here and remember that the result at the end of second pass=9                                           
Now we enter the third pass                                  
In the first pass we have added the digits 9,8,8,0,1 and the resultant sum was 26.
In second pass we have added the digits 2 and 7.and the resultant sum was 9.
In the third pass we have added the digits 4 and 3 and the resultant sum was 7.
So,the first digit for fourth pass will be 1,which is odd.
Now,we will keep adding subsequent digits till the sum becomes even.
However,we realize that this digit 1 is the last digit till the sum becomes even.  
There are no further digits.So,Stop fourth pass here and remember that the result at the end of fourth pass=1.
For the mobile number 9880127431,the resultant number (Nambiar Number) will be the concatenation of the results of the 4 passes=[26][9][7][1]=26971
NOTE 1:Please note that the number of passes required to process the given number may vary depending upon the constitution of the mobile number.                                                                                                                       
NOTE 2:Also note that,0 should be considered as an even number
Example2:
If the given mobile number is 9860857152
First digit 9 is odd
First pass results in 9+8+6+0+8+5=36
Second pass results in 7+1=8
Third pass results in 5+2=7
Note that the third pass stops at 7(even though we do not meet a change of state) because we have reached the end of the mobile number.
For the mobile number 9860857152, the resultant number(Nambiar number) will be the concatenation of the results of the 3 passes=[36][8][7]=3687
Example 3:          
If the given mobile number is 8123454210
The resultant number(Nambiar number) will be 95970
Example 4:          
If the given mobile number is 9900114279
The resultant number(Nambiar number) will be 181149
